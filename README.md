# Benchmarks-Metrics

This repository contains both dynamic and static data mined from the LLVM Test Suite and SPEC CPU programs. For each benchmark collection, Perf Stat counter metrics and Milepost Features were collected and categorized based on the CLANG optimization flags used to compile the benchmarks. The optimization flags used were: -O0, -O1, -O2, and -O3.
